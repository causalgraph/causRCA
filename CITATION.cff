abstract: "causRCA is a real-world dataset for causal discovery and root cause analysis in industrial machinery. The dataset provides diverse industrial scenarios with ground truth causal graphs, enabling the benchmarking and evaluation of causal inference and root cause analysis algorithms. The repository also includes source code for simplified causal discovery and RCA benchmarking."
