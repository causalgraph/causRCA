    "init": "Machine is in normal operation; oil temperature is within the normal range (below 70\u00b0C), and hydraulic pressure is stable and above threshold.",
    "expected_result": "Oil temperature and hydraulic pressure remain within normal operating limits throughout the process.",
    "instead_failure": "A developing  cooling issues causes oil temperature to rise above 70\u00b0C, triggering a temperature warning. Hydraulic pressure then begins to drop, while the temperature continues to rise. In some runs, the pressure drops first; in others, the oil temperature exceeds the critical 80\u00b0C threshold first. Eventually, both conditions breach their respective limits, triggering fault alarms. The operator acknowledges the errors and terminates the experiment."
