    "init": "Machine is in normal operation; coolant level is stable and above the minimum threshold; high\u2011pressure pump motor is running normally.",
    "expected_result": "Coolant level remains above the minimum threshold and the pump motor continues operating without interruption.",
    "instead_failure": "Defective or worn seals cause coolant to leak, so tank level falls below the minimum threshold and triggers a MIN\u2011level alarm. Continued low flow leads to pump cavitation/overload, causing the high\u2011pressure pump motor protection to trip and shut the motor off. Operator acknowledges the faults and terminates the experiment."
